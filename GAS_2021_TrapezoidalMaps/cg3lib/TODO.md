# Major
- [ ] Complete this ToDo list :sweat_smile:
- [ ] Make the library header only (at least for modules without dependencies)
- [ ] Create CMake configuration files in order to double support qmake and cmake
- [ ] Improve MainWindow GUI
- [x] Manage multiple pickable objects drawn in the Canvas
- [ ] Unify Meshes data structures under single abstract class
- [ ] Add a brief explanation of the content of headers containing functions (no classes)
- [x] Support LibIGL module with MSVC
- [ ] Geometric objects with type traits

# Minor
- Geometry
  - [ ] Point dimension templated (merge 2D, 3D, ..., nD point in a general class)
  - [ ] Replace Triangle area formulas with Heron's formula
- Style
  - [x] Naming of files which are interface to an external library: remove the name of the library (cgal)
  - [ ] Follow the linux kernel coding style everywhere (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
- Data Structure:
  - [ ] BipartiteGraph inherits from Graph (is it possible?)
  - [ ] AABBTree should manage AABB extractions in a better way (interface for AABB extraction?) and manage different types in the same AABBTree. Find a better way to use AABB struct in an efficient way in the nodes (initialization needed).
  - [ ] RangeTree dimension as template (is it possible?), find a way to not copy all the comparators for each lower level range tree.
  - [ ] Template of type int in RangeTree, AABBTree, Point, ... should be unsigned long long int (or size_t). Or use static_assert to check that the dimension is greater than zero.
- Meshes:
  - [ ] Reorganize EigenMeshAlgorithms and Dcel Algorithms
  - [x] Put Dcel and EigenMesh under a module called Meshes
  - [ ] Add EigenMesh member functions verticesEigenMatrix and facesEigenMatrix
  - [ ] viewer/interfaces becomes viewer/abstract_classes
  - [x] viewer/renderable_objects becomes viewer/opengl_objects
  - [ ] Complete restyle Dcel
- Viewer:
  - [ ] GLCanvas becomes a private nested class of the MainWindow
  - [ ] Disable "Space" event for 3D viewer
  - [ ] Add iterators on DrawableContainer
- CGAL:
  - [ ] Booleans 2D: transform vector of point in container of point for polygons
  - [ ] Voronoi 2D: insert on the diagram the inf edges (intersections with a built bounding box)
  - [ ] Hole Filling: better output informations
- LibIGL:
  - [ ] Remove EigenMeshLibIGLAlgorithms class, or use only when necessary
  - [ ] Too many files, it would be better to group them: for example "is_edge_manifold" and "is_vertex_manifold" functions can be grouped in a single file. Also "face_adjacencies", "vertex_adjacencies".
- All
  - [ ] Remove all "get" from member function names and make function names more "c++" like (support all old names by creating a CG3_OLD_NAMES_COMPATIBILITY and creating aliases)
